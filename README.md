# convergent_evolution projects (University of Utah)
## This repository includes odds-and-ends associated with Clark Lab projects, in the form of scripts and instructions
### Some of these scripts have been featured in various publications during my NIH T32 Hematology postdoctoral fellowship, including: TBA
#### [1] RERConverge_Hypoxia.R: walkthrough using RERConverge package for "hypoxia" phenotype
#### [2] bt_run.pl: script to run BayesTraits. Input needed are trait file, pseudo gene counts, nexus tree, independant and depenant binary test file
#### [3] filter_aln_species.pl: Perl script to filter fasta alignments based on number of sequences. To read the usage, run it without arguments.
#### [4] rename_files_combined.sh: based on files filtered from OrthoDB into orthogroups - renames files to refer to orthogroup rather than random number
#### [5] rename_species_combined.sh: based on files filtered from OrthoDB into orthogroups - renames orthoDB-specific species identifiers to new names
